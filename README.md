Parks2Go is a free interactive guide to National State Parks around the country, created by Jen Plaza. Parks2Go originally began as a React student assignment, it now fits right into your mobile, tablet, or desktop device via GH pages; offering all of its cutting-edge features and presenting them in a sleek and intuitive interface.

Parks2Go worked hard to build an app specifically focused on finding State National Parks. The app was designed to pull information on locations, descriptions, fees, activitities, topics, images, and weather.
