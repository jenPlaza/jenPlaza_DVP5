Parks2Go is an app that provides information on State Parks around the country. The apps mission is to facilitate park information to make trips as seamless as possible. Adventurers will love the app as individual state parks can be narrowed down by outdoor activities. Users can choose from a variety of activities from kayaking to site seeing. These family friendly trails are the most beautiful of the country and are worth exploring.

The home page will provide users with an interactive USA map. Each state will pull information on the different state parks and will have the opportunity to filter by outdoor activities. Once a park is chosen the app will display Park ideas, Description, Images, Activities, Topics, and Directions. The user will also have the option to choose another park from a horizontal gallery that is displayed at the bottom of the page. The footer will include a link to the About Us page, links to the state parks page of each state and connect with social media icons.

Parks2Go acquires park information from different API pulls from https://nps.gov/. This information will fit into the different areas of the park text that is displayed for Park details, Description, Images, Activities, Topics, and Directions.

For this application, I will develop 4 pages; Home, State Parks, Park, and About Us. I will be using React to create an interactive UI design. I will be dividing the application into different components for content, styling, functionality, and validation.

Parks2Go will be accessible for multiple device sizes. It will be designed with the mobile first approach and then work its way up in size. Once the website is running the site will be tested in multiple browsers, to provide the user with a seamless user experience.
